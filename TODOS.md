# App To-Dos

2. Clean up some database table naming

3. Import NCUA data about credit union assets into this app.

4. On the organizations index page we list organizations in a table or a grid. There is also a pagination component. I want to increase the per page to 100 so that 100 organizations are loaded per page by default. Then I also want to add a dropdown to the pagination component that allows me to select the per page amount and increase it or decrease it. You choose reasonable selections for this dropdown.

5. The website redesign detection functionality is working great. Now I just want to make some changes to the front end, namely the organization details view component where we show the website history. Currently, for each event you see a before and after, but I want to change the order so that it's the before, then the after, in chronological order, so you see the before on the left and the after on the right. Then, below these screenshots for each before and after, there's a link to view this snapshot, and below each link is sort of a description of header assets, body classes, etc. I want to remove that from this area. We don't need to see that. And the next thing I want to do to each of these cards is make it clickable so that you can see in a larger panel the before and after and all of the details. So let's remove some of the details from this portion. And we'll show more details when you click on it instead.

6. When I run detect redesign for 7 websites, 4 of them come back with an accurate last redesign date and snapshot data. 2 of them return the "can't predict" status saying that the site shell analysis did not detect any major redesigns. Those are https://abileneteachersfcu.org and https://riograndecu.org. Maybe you can run shell commands for these against the wayback machine api to see the snapshot data for yourself and then for these cases, I'm wondering what we should do. Do we change the settings inside of waybackmachine.php to expand the search so that hopefully we can detect major redesigns that way? I do not want to change the settings such that we sacrifice the good results we see with 5 websites, but I do need more coverage.

7. I run detect redesign for those 7 websites. One of them came back with the no-snapshots status. Which says that the wayback snapshots were filtered out by the current filters. That was for this website https://firstnewyork.org. So again, this is something I'm wondering if we can remedy by changing the settings for the WaybackMachine config. So that maybe we can get some success with examples like this. Take a look at it and let me know, but I don't want to sacrifice the good results we are getting. Just tell me what you think.
