# Importing

Documentation for the organization import flows that live under **Organizations â†’ Import** in the CRM. Each pipeline has a dedicated page that covers workflow, matching logic, and data mapping.

- HubSpot CSV import from company exports: `docs/importing/hubspot-import.md`
- NCUA quarterly data refresh: `docs/importing/ncua-import.md`

Both importers share the same upload UX and response reporting. The HubSpot flow can optionally seed new organizations when no match exists, while the NCUA flow is strictly update-only so financial metrics remain aligned with the authoritative regulator data.
